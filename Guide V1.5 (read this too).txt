Updates from V1.0 to V1.5:
+ OCR support for Korean and Chinese
+ Japanese Furigana removal (great for OCR accuracy)
+ Papago Translation (good for Korean)
+ Can change translation language from english to others (ie. Spanish, Korean, Chinese)
+ Can turn off translation 

Some notes: 
- Papago and Bing are a lot faster than DeepL so if you willing to compromise some quality, change to either two of them
- To change translation language, open settings.json with notepad and change "translation language" then save
- If the program not working properly, close then reopen it. If not worked, contact me in the Discord group
- Don't capture the browser URL bar as it will mess up with deteciton

Discord group (if you are interested or have issues setting up):

Either links is fine, don't worry if you saw the group name as "Visual Novel OCR", it is the correct one
